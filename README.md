Biomedical modelling group project 2
Dependencies are in the `pyproject.toml` file. 

`disrnn.py` and `rnn_utils.py` are from the Miller paper below. We have modified them for our task. The license file applies only to these two files. 
`Q-learning.ipynb` and `Q-learning.py` are modified from the Beron paper.
Otherwise, all work is ours. 
The data files are from [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/7E0NM5) and the Beron paper. The exact split we used is provided in this repo, and it is different to that of Beron.
